# HBnB Project

## Introduction
The HBNB project is a mini-version of the Airbnb website.
The user can set some informations about the place, users, review and amenity.
This document constitutes the complete technical information for this project.
It brings together all the UML diagrams produced to illustrate the application architecture, the business logic and the communication flows between layers. 
The goal is to provide a clear, readable and structured explanation of our project.



## Package Diagram 
In this diagramm, the purpose is to show how the global architecture of the application work. It illustrates how to application is modularly divided into three keys logical layers. 
This diagram helps developers quickly understand the structure and responsibility of each major part of the application without diving into the implementation details.

    subgraph UserInterface

    subgraph DataBase
    end

    UserInterface --> BusinessLogic
    BusinessLogic --> DataBase
```

    
## Class Diagram 

This diagram describe the interaction with the diff√©rent Logic component.
First the place have some amenity, a amenity cannot exist without place. 
A place is located by a user, this user can make a review about the quality of service. 
AMENITY, USER, PLACE AND REVIEW are the entity use by the website via the BusinessLogicLayer
Relation between place and review. 
1 place can have many review
1 Review is written by one user and one place
1 user can create many review
