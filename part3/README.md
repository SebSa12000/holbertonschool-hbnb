Part 3: Enhanced Backend with Authentication and Database Integration

1. Modify the User Model to Include Password: You will start by modifying the User model to store passwords securely using bcrypt2 and update the user registration logic.
2. Implement JWT Authentication: Secure the API using JWT tokens, ensuring only authenticated users can access protected endpoints.
3. Implement Authorization for Specific Endpoints: You will implement role-based access control to restrict certain actions (e.g., admin-only actions).
4. SQLite Database Integration: Transition from in-memory data storage to SQLite as the persistent database during development.
5. Map Entities Using SQLAlchemy: Map existing entities (User, Place, Review, Amenity) to the database using SQLAlchemy and ensure relationships are well-defined.
6. Prepare for MySQL in Production: Towards the end of this phase, youâ€™ll configure the application to use MySQL in production and SQLite for development.
7. Database Design and Visualization: Use mermaid.js to create entity-relationship diagrams for your database schema.
